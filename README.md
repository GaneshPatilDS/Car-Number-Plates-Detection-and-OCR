# ðŸš— License Plate Detection with OpenCV

## Overview

This Python script uses OpenCV for real-time license plate detection using a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier. Capture video frames from your webcam, detect license plates, and save the images on request.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file (e.g., `haarcascade_russian_plate_number.xml`)
- Webcam or video source

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

2. Download the pre-trained Haar Cascade XML file.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python license_plate_detection.py
```

4. Adjust `min_area` for different area thresholds.

5. Press 's' to save detected license plates.

## Features

- Real-time license plate detection.
- Display of detected plates with bounding rectangles.
- Save detected license plate images.

## Customization

- Modify `min_area` for area threshold adjustments.
- Replace the Haar Cascade XML file for different detection styles.
